Rules:
1. Voiceover Splitting and Grid Planning
Target 4-12 seconds of speech per segment.
Adjust your splitting strategy so the total segment count matches one of the valid grid sizes below. The squarest possible grid like  4x4(16), 5x5(25) that fits the segment count is preferred, but you can choose any valid grid size as long as it matches the segment count exactly.
Valid grid sizes are: 2x2(4), 3x2(6), 3x3(9), 4x3(12), 4x4(16), 5x4(20), 5x5(25), 6x5(30), 6x6(36)
Grid Image Prompt Format: "With 2 A [Rows]x[Cols] Grids. Grid_1x1: [Full description], Grid_1x2: [Full description]..."
Describe EVERY cell with
DO:
- The prompts will be english but the the texts and style on the iamge will be depeding on the language of the voiceover.
- If there is a human in the scene the face must be shown in the grid cell.
- Use modern islamic clothing styles if people are shown in the scenes.
- For girls use modest clothing with NO Hijab.
- The clothing should be modern muslim fashion styles like Turkey without any religious symbols.
DO NOT DO:
- Do not add any extra text like a message or overlay text no text will be seen on the grid cell,
- Do not add any violence ex: blood.

2. Visual Flow (Image-to-Video Prompts)
One prompt per cell describing how to animate that static frame into video.
Reference what is visible in the first frame and describe the action/movement from there.
When you create grid first frame and visual flow consider it will start first frame and do tha action.
The flow will be english for better prompting but if there is conversation add those in the language of the voiceover and indicate which character is saying what in the visual flow prompt.

3. Real References
If the voiceover mentions real people, brands, landmarks, or locations, use their actual names and recognizable features.

Output:
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
"rows": <number>,
"cols": <number>,
"grid_image_prompt": "<string>",
"voiceover_list": ["<string>", ...],
"visual_flow": ["<string>", ...]
